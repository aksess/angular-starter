# AngularJS dashboard

![screenshot](screenshots/dashboard.jpg)

Fully featured dashboard built with AngularJS. This project is ideal to start an AngularJS app using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/).
It's greatly inspired/copied from [rdash/rdash-angular](https://github.com/rdash/rdash-angular) but adapted with other tools and with more features.

With this template you will have :

- a login system already setted (see [AuthSrv](https://github.com/loicknuchel/angularjs-dashboard/blob/master/app/scripts/services.js))
- an advanced logging & tracking errors system with mixpanel integration example (see [log.js](https://github.com/loicknuchel/angularjs-dashboard/blob/master/app/scripts/log.js))
- many helpers such as [filters for dates](https://github.com/loicknuchel/angularjs-dashboard/blob/master/app/scripts/filters.js)
- [moment](http://momentjs.com/) (date manipulation lib) & [lodash](http://lodash.com/) (functionnal utility helpers) are included
